6. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR USAGE
-----------------------------------

Based on the analysis, here are recommendations for using the question pool:

• For survey development:
  - Use question_pool_200.parquet for initial testing
  - Use question_pool_500.parquet for pilot studies
  - Use question_pool_1000.parquet for full surveys

• For question decimation:
  - The K-means clustering with k=175 provides good separation
  - Consider manual review of cluster representatives
  - Balance axis representation in final selection

• For uniform distribution:
  - The generated sets show good uniformity across axes
  - Consider using balanced sampling for specific applications
  - Monitor for axis bias in final question selection

• Data quality:
  - Review generated variations for naturalness
  - Consider semantic validation of embeddings
  - Test with sample respondents before deployment
