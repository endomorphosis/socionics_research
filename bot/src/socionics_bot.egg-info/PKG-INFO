# Socionics Discord Bot (LLM-Assisted)

Purpose: Provide structured, safeguarded access to Socionics research information, educational explanations, and guided self-reflection prompts within the Discord community.

## Functional Scope (v0.1)
- /about_socionics: Neutral overview of theory + empirical status.
- /theory <topic>: Returns concise, sourced explanation (rate-limited).
- /intertype <type1> <type2>: Summarize canonical relation description + evidence gaps + suggested falsifiable questions.
- /reflect: Issues a randomized structured prompt (logged with prompt_id).
- /consent: Runs consent onboarding flow (integrates with repository governance service).
- /my_type_help: Provides a structured questionnaire to help users gather observations; DOES NOT assign a type automatically.
- /explain_functions: High-level definitions with caveats.
- /privacy: Displays data handling & logging details.

## Out-of-Scope (Hard Guardrails)
- Direct assignment of a user's Socionics type.
- Personalized coaching or psychological advice.
- Medical or diagnostic claims.

## Conditional Guidance for Type Exploration
Workflow:
1. User runs /my_type_help.
2. Bot returns a 6-dimension self-observation checklist (energy focus, information seeking pattern, comfort/volition cues, decision framing, discourse style, feedback sensitivity).
3. User optionally answers follow-up questions (1–2 per dimension).
4. Bot summarizes patterns using neutral descriptors and suggests 2–3 candidate study tasks (e.g., record a monologue under two prompt categories) rather than naming a type.
5. If user persists in asking for a type, bot reiterates policy and offers resources: methodology doc link + explanatory article.

## Interpersonal Dynamics Explanation
- Provide standard relation category description (e.g., Duality) + highlight: "Empirical Evidence Status: unverified / limited / emerging".
- Encourage formulation of testable interactions: e.g., "Measure coordination time on novel tasks vs. matched non-Dual pairs." 

## Safeguards
- Profanity / harassment filter before LLM call.
- Red-team prompt tests at startup (ensure blocked outputs for disallowed requests).
- Response provenance: prepend banner if answer includes theoretical claims not yet empirically validated.
- Logging (hashed user ID, command, prompt_id, timestamp, model version, guardrail flags) to JSONL (rotated daily).

## Evaluation Metrics
- Average response latency < 2.5s (95th < 5s) excluding first-token cold start.
- Guardrail violation rate < 0.5% of requests (auto escalation if >1%).
- User satisfaction (thumb reaction ratio) > 70% positive on /theory.
- Escalations to human moderators < 1 per 500 commands (steady state).

## Architecture Overview
```
Discord Gateway → Command Router → Guardrail Pipeline → Intent Classifier → Tool/LLM Orchestrator → Response Formatter → Discord API
```

Guardrail Pipeline Components:
- Pattern Blocker (regex for explicit type assignment requests)
- Sensitive Topic Classifier (basic safety)
- Rate Limiter (token bucket per user + global concurrency)
- PII Scrubber (optional for logs)

Tool/LLM Orchestration:
- Static Knowledge: Pre-rendered markdown snippets (versioned).
- Dynamic Retrieval: Local vector store of theory documents (FAISS) for /theory queries.
- Template-fused prompt constructing disclaimers + citations.

## Data Sources
- `docs/intro_socionics_research.md`
- `docs/operational_indicators.md`
- `docs/annotation_protocol.md`

## Future Extensions
- Semi-automated annotation suggestion for internal raters (/annotator mode).
- Multi-language support with translation quality confidence scores.
- Adaptive clarification questions (dialog state machine) for deeper concept explanations.

## Local Development
(Placeholder; add install instructions once dependencies are finalized.)
