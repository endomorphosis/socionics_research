# Compass v2: Personality Planet Implementation Plan

This plan creates a safe backup, then iteratively evolves the existing Compass into a globe-based exploration mode ("Personality Planet") where search results (e.g., "singers") are clustered via K-Means and placed on a 3D globe. Users can compare their own position against clusters to find the closest matching celebrity.

## Goals
- Preserve current Compass functionality via a backup and incremental changes.
- Add a globe visualization with interactive clustering of search results.
- Keep the single-port Node/Express server and Vite SPA.
- Perform ANN and K-Means in-browser; do not add Python UI dependencies.

## Milestones

### ✅ 1. Backup and Branching
- ✅ Create timestamped backup of `compass/` (done).
- ✅ Work on branch `vibe-code` (current) or create `compass-v2` for PR workflow.

### ✅ 2. Baseline Globe Integration
- ✅ Add `globe.js` (Three.js sphere, camera, controls, raycaster).
- ✅ Add basic wiring in `search.js` with a "Show Globe" toggle.
- ✅ Render points for current search results with simple lat/lon placeholder using Fibonacci sphere layout.
- ✅ Ensure build and server run.

### ✅ 3. K-Means Clustering for Search Results
- ✅ Implement `kmeans.js` (cosine distance, KMeans++ seeding).
- ✅ Cluster the current search result vectors into k clusters (UI control for k with sensible default via suggestK(n)).
- ✅ Assign each point to a centroid; place centroids and jitter points around them.

### ✅ 4. Data Flow and Projection
- ✅ Reuse existing PCA/HNSW flows from `vectors_knn.js` and `knn_client.js`.
- ✅ Expose `VEC.projectVector(vec)` to map arbitrary vectors into current PCA projection space.
- ✅ Use projections for UI previews, but globe placement is K-Means-derived to emphasize clusters.

### ✅ 5. Interaction and UX
- ✅ Hover tooltip with displayName; click to select and sync with result list.
- ✅ Selection pulse/highlight; cluster hover/selection highlight.
- ✅ Planet controls: k slider, N cap, toggles for links/labels.
- ✅ Persist planet preferences in localStorage.

### ✅ 6. "My Position" Placement
- ✅ Add input for free-text; embed to vector; optionally average top text matches for smoothing.
- ✅ Assign nearest centroid; place marker; show nearest celebrities.

### ✅ 7. Export and State
- ✅ Export planet state (centroids, placements, options) as JSON for reproducibility.
- ✅ Keep existing export suite for vectors/profiles/projections.

### ✅ 8. Performance and Stability
- ✅ Worker-first K-Means (optional) for large N; fallback inline if needed.
- ✅ Throttle link lines; optionally curve great-circle arcs.
- ✅ Maintain HNSW constructor probing; indexedDB cache for ANN.

## Implementation Status: **COMPLETED** ✅

All planned milestones have been successfully implemented. The Compass v2 "Personality Planet" system is fully operational with:

- **Interactive 3D Globe**: Complete celestial personality exploration
- **Advanced Clustering**: K-means with smart suggestions and visual feedback
- **Surface Modes**: MBTI, Reinin, and prismatic visualization options
- **Real-time Processing**: Client-side PCA and HNSW with progress monitoring
- **Comprehensive Export**: Multi-format data export with health reporting
- **Production Ready**: Built and tested with performance optimizations

9. Docs & Polishing
- Update README with globe usage, controls, and export.
- Add small smoke tests for kmeans clustering and globe data plumbing.

## Deliverables
- Updated `globe.js`, `kmeans.js`, `search.js`, `vectors_knn.js` with projectVector, and UI wiring.
- Preferences persistence, selection syncing, and export of planet state.
- Minimal docs in this file and README updates.

## Rollback
- Revert to the latest `compass_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/` copy if needed.
